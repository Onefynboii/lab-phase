                <h2>About Me</h2> <br>
                <p>Welcome! I'm Ibrahim, a passionate footballer & web developer with little experience but zeal for knowledge. This is a portfolio for the footballer and develper part of me. First of all, football is life so yeah, I play as much as i can and dream of playing professionally. My primary position is the number 9 (main striker) but i can play anywhere from the attack.</p> <br> <br>

                <p> My dream club is Fc Barcelona; I've been a culer since childhood. It would be great to play at the Camp Nou, I see it hapenning someday. I love staying healthy and eating good food</p> <br> <br>
                
                <p> As a developer, I have little experience but a lot of ideas about Website Development. I started learning the essentials at GoMyCode 3 months ago. It has been a fun experience and I look to become a professional developer on the side, football being my main focus. I would also like to learn other tech courses, with UI/UX design on my mind. Let's see what the future brings.</p>
